The corrected CSS code which addresses the spacing issue in `calc()`:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100px + 20px);
  /* Correct: No spaces around '+' operator */
}

.element2 {
  width: calc(50% - 20px);
  /* Correct: No spaces around '-' operator */
}

.element3 {
  width: calc(2 * 100px);
  /* Correct: No spaces around '*' operator */
}

.element4 {
  width: calc(200px / 2);
  /* Correct: No spaces around '/' operator */
}
```

This corrected code ensures that the calculations are performed as intended.

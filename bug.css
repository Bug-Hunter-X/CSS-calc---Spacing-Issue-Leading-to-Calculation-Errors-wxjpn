The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes unexpected results arise due to spacing issues.  For instance, the following code will fail to calculate correctly because of extra spaces:

```css
.element {
  width: calc( 100px + 20px );
}
```

The correct usage would be to remove the spaces immediately adjacent to the operators:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100px + 20px);
}
```
